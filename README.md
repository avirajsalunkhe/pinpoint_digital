## üìù Form Integration with Google Apps Script

The contact form is configured to send submission data to a Google Apps Script URL. This allows you to collect leads in a Google Sheet for free.

### How It Works:
1.  A user fills out and submits the form.
2.  The JavaScript `fetch()` API sends the form data via a `POST` request to the specified `scriptURL`.
3.  The Google Apps Script receives the data, processes it, and appends it as a new row in a connected Google Sheet.
4.  The script returns a JSON response (`{result: 'success'}` or an error message).
5.  The JavaScript on the frontend displays a success or error message to the user based on the response.

### How to Set Up Your Own Form Backend:
1.  **Create a Google Sheet** to store the form responses.
2.  Go to `Extensions > Apps Script` to open the script editor.
3.  Paste the Google Apps Script code for handling POST requests (you can find many templates online for this).
4.  **Deploy** the script as a **Web App**.
5.  **Copy the Web App URL** provided after deployment.
6.  In the `index.html` file, find the following JavaScript block and replace the placeholder `scriptURL` with your own URL:

    ```javascript
    // ... inside the <script> tag at the bottom of the HTML file
    
    const scriptURL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
    
    form.addEventListener('submit', e => {
      // ... rest of the submission logic
    });
    ```
